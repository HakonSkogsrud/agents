       "In 2025, several AI agent frameworks have emerged, each offering unique capabilities:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Agent Lightning**: A flexible framework enabling reinforcement learning-based training of large language models (LLMs) for any AI agent. It decouples agent execution from training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents and handling complex interactions like multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Cognitive Kernel-Pro**: An open-source, multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. It focuses on curating high-quality training data across domains like web, file, code, and general reasoning, and introduces novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance robustness and performance. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00414?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LightAgent**: A lightweight yet powerful agentic framework that integrates core functionalities such as memory, tools, and tree of thought, while maintaining an extremely lightweight structure. As a fully open-source solution, it seamlessly integrates with mainstream chat platforms, enabling developers to easily build self-learning agents. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09292?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Kruti**: A multilingual AI agent and chatbot developed by the Indian company Ola Krutrim. It is designed to perform real-world tasks for users, such as booking taxis and ordering food, by integrating directly with various online services. It is notable for its ability to understand and respond in multiple Indian languages. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruti?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: An open standard introduced by Anthropic to standardize the way AI systems like LLMs integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources. MCP provides a universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts, aiming to become a universal open standard for AI system connectivity and interoperability.
